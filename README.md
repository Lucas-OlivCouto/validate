This package is the next iteration of our [editrules](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/editrules/index.html) package for the R environment for statistical computing.

The validate package will focus on data validation, leaving tasks like error localization to packages that are built upon it. `validate` can handle more general rules then editrules, including cross-record rules cross-dataset rules and functional dependencies.
