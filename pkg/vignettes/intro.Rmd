## Introduction
The validate package is intended to make checking your data easy, maintainable and reproducible. The validate package
allows you to
- Test your dataset(s) against predefined rules, either in- or cross-dataset
- Store and re-use user-defined indicators, such as summary statistics
- Compare multiple versions of your dataset as it gets processed step by step during for example data cleaning.

We've added plenty of summarizing and visualisations so you can get a quick and attractive look at the results.

### A quick example
Here's an example demonstrating the typical workflow. We'll use the built-in ```women``` dataset.
```{r }
data(women)
summary(women)
```
Validating data is all about checking whether a dataset meets presumtions or
expectiations you have about it, and the validate package makes is super easy
for you to define those expectations. Let's define a ```validator``` object
that checks whether height and weight are positive.
```{r}
library(validate)
v <- validator(height > 0, weight > 0)
v
```
The validator object has stored the rule and assigned names to them (V0001 and
V0002) for future reference.  To check this, we confront the dataset with the
validation rules we've just defined:
```{r}
cf <- confront(v, women)
cf
```
The object ```cf``` contains the result of checking the data in ```women```
against the expectations in ```v```. The fact that there are no warnings or
errors means that indeed each rule could be evaluated sucessfully (an error
would occur for example, if we'd missspell height). Now let's take a look at
the acual results.
```{r}
summary(cf)
```
Here, we see that of the 15 records in the ```women``` dataset, 15 pass the
test. Consequently, there are no records that fail the test or yield ```NA```.
Now, suppose that we expect that the BMI (weight divided by height squared) of
each person to be below 23. We need to express the weight in kg and the height
in meters, so the equation for BMI becomes
$$
BMI = \frac{weight\times0.45359}{(height\times0.0254)^2}
$$
Moreover, we demand that the average BMI is between 22 and 22.5.  Let's create
another validator object that first computes the BMI and next test whether the
BMI values meet our expectations.
```{r}
v <- validator(
  BMI := (weight*0.45359)/(height*0.0254)^2
  , height > 0
  , weight > 0
  , BMI < 23
  , mean(BMI) > 22 & mean(BMI) < 22.5
)
v
```
Checking is easy as before:
```{r}
cf <- confront(v,women)
summary(cf)
```
We see that of 15 records, 10 meet our demands and that the mean BMI is not within the range we expected.

## Validation rules

### What are validation rules?

Informally, a validation rule states an expectation or presumption that one
wishes a data set to satisfy before reliable statistical analyses can take
place. It is common to distinguish between the following types of validation
rules.

- **In-variable validation rules.** These concern basic range checks, for example: is the weight variable nonnegative?
- **Cross-variable, in-record validation.** These rules check inter-variable
  relations. The test on BMI-values in the quick example above is an example of
  cross-variable validation. 
- **Cross-record validation.** These rules are characterised by the fact that
  theire evaluation depends on more than a single record. For example, one
  might expect that no _salary_ in a column of salaries exceeds ten times the
  median salary of the column. The test on the mean BMI-value in the quick
  example above is another demonstration of cross-record validation. 
- **Cross-dataset validation.** Compare (statistics of) multiple datasets. For
  example, one may expect that this year's revenue is within 10% of last
  year's.

The validate package offers facilities for all these types of validation rules.

Technically, a validation rule is an expression (or function, the difference
between the two is not very big) that takes some data and returns either
```TRUE```, ```FALSE``` or ```NA```. The latter occurs only when the dataset
contains too many missing values to compute the result of the expression. In
the validate package, a validation rule is the subset of R-expressions whose
final result is determined by any of the following operators or functions.
```{r,echo=FALSE}
s <- validate:::SYNTAX$validationsymbols
s[!s%in% c(':=',':')]
```
Besides these operators, you can define rules that consist of calls to code
```is.-`` functions. 
```{r}
validator(is.numeric(x),x>0)
```

### Storing and retrieving validation rules

#### From the commandline
Validation rules may be defined and stored from the commandline with the
```validator``` command. Optionally, you may name each rule or a subset of
them. A non-named rule will be assigned a name automatically.
```{r}
v <- validator(
  xpos = x > 0   # a rule stating that variable x must be positive
  , yneg = y < 0 # a rule stating that variable y must be negative
  , x + y == z   # a rule stating that x and y must add up to z
)
v
```
Note that the result of the above rules is indeed the result of one of the
operators shown above. If we try to add a rule whose result is determined
otherwise, that rule is skipped with a warning. For example:
```{r}
v <- validator(
  x + y == z # this is a validation rule
  , x + y    # this is not a validation rule
)
v
```
Finally, we note that the result of the ```validator``` function is an object of class ```validator```.

#### From file
It is possible to define your validation rules in a textfiles, so you can
mainain them separately, annotate them in the comments and reuse them accross R
sessions. For example, suppose we have a file called ```myrules.txt``` with the
following content.
```
# content of myrules.txt

# some basic range checks
height > 0
weight > 0

# this variable represents the quetelet index
BMI := (weight*0.45359)/(height*0.0254)^2

# we expect everyone's bmi to be below 23
BMI < 23
```
To read the above rules, you can either copy the above code in a file called
```myrules.txt``` or read it from the text file that comes installed with the
package as in the example below.
```{r}
examplefile <- system.file('examples/myrules.txt',package='validate')
w <- validator(.files=examplefile)
w
```
You can actually feed a vector of file names to ```validator```. The files will
be read in the order of occurrence in the vector and all rules are added to a
single validator object. This allows you to combine rules that apply to many of
your data files in a single general file and store lesser-used rules in
separate files. Or, one could store group definitions (discussed
[below](#groups)) in one file and rules using groups in another.

At the moment it is not yet possible to name rules that are stored in a file.

#### Subsetting validation rules
Subsets can be selected with the single bracket operator, similar to vectors.
You may use names, logical indices or numbers, just like with regular R
vectors. The result of indexing a ```validator``` object is a new and smaller
validator object. Using the validator ```w``` defined in the previous example:
```{r}
w[1:2]
w[c('V0003','V0004')]
w[(1:4) < 2]
```

#### Different variables, similar rules: variable groups.
<a name="groups"></a>
We have already seen that a validator object can contain special rules, in the
form of assignments. There is one more special type of rule, which can be used
to make maintainig your rulebase easyer when many variables have to obey
similar rules. For example, suppose you have a variable ```x```, and if
```x>0```, then all variables ```y1, y2, ... , y5``` must be larger than zero
as well. You may specify this by denoting five rules of the form 
```if ( x > 0 ) yi > 0```, ```i``` running from 1 to 5. However, the following
also works:
```{r}
v <- validator(
  G : { y1; y2; y3; y4; y5 }
  , if ( x > 0 ) G > 0
)
v
```
(As a side note, observe that such an if-else rule indeed evaluates to
```TRUE```, ```FALSE``` or ```NA```, since a rule of the form ```if ( P ) Q```
is interpreted as ```!P | Q```.)

Here, ```G``` is called a _group variable_. When ```v``` is used, for example
in a call to ```confront```, a copy of ```V0002``` is generated for each
element in the group.
```{r}
# let us generate some random data with x and y1...y5 values
d <- data.frame(x=rnorm(100))
for ( i in 1:5 ) d[[paste0('y',i)]] <- rnorm(100)
head(d)
# confrontation of the data with the validator object 
cf <- confront(v,d)
summary(cf)
```

### Properties of the validator object
One may retrieve the names of the rules stored in a validator object using the
```names``` function. 
```{r}
v <- validator(typecheck = is.numeric(y), z:=2*x, xbigger = z > y)
names(v)
```
It is also possible to retrieve the list of variables that are contained in the
validator object. Either for the whole object or per rule.
```{r}
variables(v)
variables(v,matrix=TRUE)
```
By default, the assigned variable ```z``` is not shown, since it doesn't refer
to a variable occurring in the data but is only temporary (dummy) variable that
makes your rules easier to maintain. Can however request it.
```{r}
variables(v,dummy=TRUE)
```

We can find out where rules have been defined using the ```origin``` function.
```{r}
origin(v)
origin(w)[1]
```
From the printed output, you may have noticed that a ```validator``` object is
a reference object. You  as a user will probably note much of this. It only
serves us, the package authors, to control the amount of copying taking place
when we process validator objects internally.


### Analysing validation
A _validation_ object is the result of confronting a set of validating expressions
with a dataset. It contains all information gathered during the validation, for example

- Which validating expressions could be executed
- Which validating expressions yielded a warning
- The results of the expression
- The way the ```confront``` function was called. 

Just like for ```lm``` objects, for example, there are functions that can be used
to extract or summarize information stored in ```validation``` objects. We will use
the built-in ```iris``` dataset in the next example.

```{r}
v <- validator(
  NUM : {Sepal.Width; Sepal.Length; Petal.Length; Petal.Width}
  , isnum = is.numeric(NUM)
  , ispos = NUM > 0
  , ratio = if(Species == 'setosa') Sepal.Length/Sepal.Width < 1.7
  , I := Species == 'setosa'
  , means = mean(Sepal.Width[I]) > mean(Sepal.Width[!I])
)
cf <- confront(v,iris)
cf
```
Here, we test whether the length and width variables are stored as numerics and if they are positive or not. Furthermore, we compare the means of two subgroups (_setosa_ and other species) and test weather the sepal length to width ratio for _setosa_ is within our expected range.

The ```summary``` function returns a ```data.frame``` that summarizes the results.
Here, we'll just print the first five columns.
```{r}
summary(cf)[1:5]
```
Here, we see that mean test as well as each of the ```is.numeric``` tests yield a single confrontation. That is: these tests return a single ```TRUE```, ```FALSE``` or
```NA``` for the entire dataset. The positivity checks on the other hand can be tested
for te each record and therefore yield 150 (the number of records) results each. The same holds for the ratio test and in fact, we see that there is one observation failing the ratio test.

We van get a closer look at the results by extracting the values:
```{r}
val <- values(cf)
class(val)
```
Here ```val``` is a list, containing arrays of ```logical```s. The ```values``` function tries to simplify results by combining the results of expressions when they have the same dimension.
```{r}
val[[1]]
```
